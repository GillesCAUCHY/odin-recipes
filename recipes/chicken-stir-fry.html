  <h2>A Flavorful Chicken Stir-Fry Recipe</h2>
  <p>
    Chicken stir-fry is a vibrant and quick dish packed with colorful vegetables and tender chicken, all coated in a
    savory sauce. Start by slicing boneless chicken breast into thin strips and marinating them in soy sauce and
    cornstarch for 10 minutes to enhance flavor and texture. Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high
    heat, then cook the chicken until browned and set aside. In the same pan, stir-fry minced garlic, sliced onion, bell
    pepper, and broccoli florets until the vegetables are crisp-tender.
  </p>
  <p>
    Return the chicken to the pan and pour in your favorite stir-fry sauce, tossing everything together to coat evenly.
    Cook for an additional 2–3 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and the sauce has thickened slightly. Drizzle
    with sesame oil for extra aroma, if desired. Serve immediately over steamed rice or noodles for a satisfying meal
    that’s ready in under 30 minutes.
