  <h2>A simple yet enjoyable Lasagna Recipe</h2>
  <p>
    Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish known for its rich layers of flavor and comforting texture. To start, prepare a
    hearty meat sauce by browning ground beef or a mix of beef and pork in a pan with olive oil, garlic, and onions. Add
    tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, and a blend of Italian herbs like oregano and basil, then let the sauce simmer for
    at least 30 minutes to deepen the flavors. While the sauce cooks, boil lasagna noodles until al dente, or use
    no-boil noodles for convenience. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese with an egg, grated Parmesan, and a pinch of
    salt and pepper to create a creamy filling.

  <p>
    To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of
    noodles, a generous spread of the ricotta mixture, and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella. Repeat the layers,
    finishing with a final layer of noodles topped with meat sauce and mozzarella. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F
    (190°C) for about 25–30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden. Let it rest for a few minutes before
    serving to allow the layers to set, then enjoy with a side of garlic bread or a fresh salad!
