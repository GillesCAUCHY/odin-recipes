  <h2>A Timeless Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe</h2>
  <p>
    Chocolate chip cookies are a classic American treat loved for their crispy edges and soft, chewy centers. To begin,
    cream together softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a
    time, followed by vanilla extract, to create a smooth base. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda,
    and salt, then gradually mix these dry ingredients into the wet mixture. Finally, fold in chocolate chips to
    distribute them evenly throughout the dough.
  </p>
  <p>
    Drop rounded spoonfuls of dough onto a lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading.
    Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 9–11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers are
    still soft. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack. Serve
    warm with a glass of milk, or store in an airtight container for up to a week.
